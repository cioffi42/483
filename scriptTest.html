<h1>VELOCITY</h1>

<p><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none;
text-underline:none'>In kinematics, velocity is the rate of change of the
position of an object, equivalent to a specification of its speed and direction
of motion. Speed describes only how fast an object is moving, whereas velocity
gives both how fast and in what direction the object is moving<span
class=GramE>.[</span>1] If a car is said to travel at 60 km/h, its speed has
been specified. However, if the car is said to move at 60 km/h to the north,
its velocity has now been specified. To have a constant velocity, an object
must have a constant speed in a constant direction. Constant direction
constrains the object to motion in a straight path (the object's path does not
curve). Thus, a constant velocity means motion in a straight line at a constant
speed. If there is a change in speed, direction, or both, then the object is
said to have a changing velocity and is undergoing <span class=GramE>an
acceleration</span>. For example, a car moving at a constant 20 <span
class=SpellE>kilometres</span> per hour in a circular path has a constant
speed, but does not have a constant velocity because its direction changes.
Hence, the car is considered to be undergoing <span class=GramE>an acceleration</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none;
text-underline:none'>Velocity is a vector physical quantity; both magnitude and
direction are required to define it. The scalar absolute value (magnitude) of
velocity is called &quot;speed&quot;, a quantity that is measured in <span
class=SpellE>metres</span> per second (m/s or m</span></span><span

text-underline:none'>s&#8722;1) when using the SI (metric) system. For example,
&quot;5 <span class=SpellE>metres</span> per second&quot; is a scalar (not a
vector), whereas &quot;5 <span class=SpellE>metres</span> per second east&quot;
is a vector. The rate of change of velocity (in m/s) as a function of time (<span
class=SpellE>in s</span>) is &quot;acceleration&quot; (in m/s2 – stated &quot;<span
class=SpellE>metres</span> per second per second&quot;), which describes how an
object's speed and direction of travel change at each point in time. In science
a &quot;deceleration&quot; is called a &quot;negative acceleration&quot;, for
example: -2 m/s2.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In physics, acceleration is the rate at which the velocity
of a body changes with time.[1] In general, velocity and acceleration are
vector quantities, with magnitude and direction,[2][3] though in many cases
only magnitude is considered (sometimes with negative values for deceleration,
treating it as a one dimensional vector). Acceleration is accompanied by a
force, as described by Newton's Second Law; the force, as a vector, is the
product of the mass of the object being accelerated and the acceleration (vector).
The SI unit of acceleration is the meter per second squared (m/s2).<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For example, an object such as a car that starts from
standstill, then travels in a straight line at increasing speed, is
accelerating in the direction of travel. If the car changes direction at
constant speedometer reading, there is strictly speaking <span class=GramE>an
acceleration</span> although it is often not so described; passengers in the
car will experience a force pushing them back into their seats in linear
acceleration, and a sideways force on changing direction. If the speed of the
car decreases, it is usual and meaningful to speak of deceleration;
mathematically it is acceleration in the opposite direction to that of motion.</p>
